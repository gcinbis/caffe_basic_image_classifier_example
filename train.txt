This file should only contain a list of <path> <class_id> pairs. That is, it should look like this:

image_path_1 class_id_1
image_path_2 class_id_2
...
image_path_N class_id_N

where N is the number of training images.

Class ids should be integers in the range [0,C), where C is the number of classes.
Ids should follow the order of the classes in classnames.txt 

Typically, within each class, a random subset of all training images (eg., 50% percent of images) 
are listed within train.txt, and the remaining ones are used as the validation images (listed within val.txt).
